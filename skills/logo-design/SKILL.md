# Logo Design

## Overview

You CAN and SHOULD design logos. You will CREATE actual logo files, not just provide recommendations.

**Your workflow:**
1. Conduct strategic discovery (ask questions, analyze context)
2. Perform competitive visual analysis
3. CREATE 3 strategic logo directions (actual SVG files, not descriptions)
4. DELIVER production-ready logos with rationale and usage guidelines

**Supporting skills (load when needed):**
- **superpowers:designing-ui-color**: For all color selection and palette decisions
- **superpowers:designing-ui-typography**: For font/typeface selection in wordmarks
- **superpowers:svg-generator**: For creating production-ready SVG logo files

**Critical:** Every logo direction must include actual working SVG files created with svg-generator, actual colors selected with designing-ui-color, and actual fonts chosen with designing-ui-typography (if applicable).

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User requests logo design or rebranding
- Need to create visual identity marks
- Evaluating or improving existing logos
- Designing icons or brand symbols

## Discovery First (Non-Negotiable)

**NEVER jump straight to designing.** Always ask:

1. **Business Context**
   - What does the company do? (specific value proposition)
   - Who is the target audience? (demographics, psychographics)
   - Who are competitors? (how to differentiate visually)
   - What is unique about this company?

2. **Brand Positioning**
   - Brand personality (innovative/traditional, playful/serious, premium/accessible)
   - Emotional response desired from audience
   - Industry norms and whether to conform or break them

3. **Practical Constraints**
   - Where will logo appear? (web, print, signage, products)
   - Size range requirements (favicon to billboard)
   - Color constraints (printing limitations, accessibility needs)

**If user can't answer these**: Help them think through it. Don't design without strategic foundation.

**No exceptions:**
- Not when user says "don't ask questions"
- Not when deadline is tight
- Not when user says "you're the expert, you decide"
- Not when you think you know enough from the brief
- Don't "make strategic assumptions" - that's designing blind
- Don't document assumptions in place of asking
- Minimum viable discovery (3 questions) beats no discovery

## Competitive Visual Analysis (Required)

Before designing, map the competitive landscape:

1. **Identify 3-5 direct competitors** targeting same audience
2. **Analyze their visual strategies:**
   - Color palettes (what's oversaturated in this space?)
   - Style approach (minimalist, illustrative, playful, corporate?)
   - Logo types (wordmark, icon, combination mark?)

3. **Find the positioning gap:**
   - Where can you differentiate visually?
   - What visual territory is unclaimed?
   - How do you signal difference without being inappropriate for the industry?

**Example - Productivity SaaS:**
- Landscape: Split between playful (Asana/ClickUp bright colors) vs corporate (Monday/Jira minimal blues)
- Gap opportunity: Professional but approachable (between the two extremes)
- Design implication: Clean blue (not bright/playful), flow metaphor (not rigid grid)

**Red flag:** Designing without checking what competitors look like.

## Constraint-Based Filtering (Before Design)

**Use constraints to rule out entire categories upfront:**

### Budget Constraints Filter

**You create the logo designs for free.** Budget only constrains licensing and implementation costs.

| Budget Focus | Font Licensing | Color Complexity | Implementation |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| < $500 | System fonts only ($0) | Single-color preferred (printing: $50/1k stickers vs $200/1k full-color) | User implements themselves |
| $500-$2k | Basic commercial fonts ($50-$200, see superpowers:designing-ui-typography) | Multi-color acceptable | User implements with potential contractor help |
| $2k-$10k | Premium custom typography ($200-$2k, see superpowers:designing-ui-typography) | Any color complexity | Professional implementation possible |
| $10k+ | High-end custom fonts ($2k-$10k+) | Any complexity | Full professional rollout |

**What budget does NOT constrain:**
- Design complexity (you create complex SVGs as easily as simple ones)
- Iteration cycles (you iterate for free)
- Number of logo directions (you always create 3 strategic directions)
- Quality of deliverables (always production-ready SVGs)

**Why constraints aren't problems - they're filters:**

Constraints focus your solution space BEFORE you start designing. Design within viable territory for the user's context.

**Process:** List constraints → Rule out incompatible approaches → Design only within viable territory

## Three Directions Rule

**Create and present 3 strategic directions**, not just visual variations.

For each direction:
1. Design the concept (icon style, wordmark approach, visual metaphor)
2. Use superpowers:svg-generator to CREATE the actual logo file
3. Use superpowers:designing-ui-color to SELECT actual colors
4. Use superpowers:designing-ui-typography to CHOOSE actual fonts (if wordmark)
5. Document the rationale and trade-offs

Each direction should:
- Represent different positioning strategy
- Include working SVG file (not just description)
- Have clear rationale for why this approach works
- Show trade-offs vs other approaches (quantified when possible)

**Example for B2B SaaS "DataFlow":**
- Direction 1: Abstract geometric - CREATE SVG with geometric shapes, SELECT blue palette, present working file
- Direction 2: Wordmark-focused - CHOOSE font with designing-ui-typography, CREATE SVG wordmark, present working file
- Direction 3: Subtle metaphor - CREATE flow icon SVG, SELECT colors, present working file

Don't present: same logo in 3 colors, or descriptions without actual files.

## Quantifying Trade-Offs

**Include numbers to make trade-offs actionable:**

**Instead of:** "Single color is more budget-friendly"
**Say:** "Single color printing: $50 for 1,000 stickers vs Full color: $200 for 1,000 stickers (Savings: $150 or 4x volume for same cost)"

### Common Quantifiable Dimensions

- **Print costs:** Single-color vs multi-color (exact $ difference, e.g., $50/1k stickers vs $200/1k)
- **Typography licensing:** $0 (system fonts) vs $200-$10k (custom typefaces - see superpowers:designing-ui-typography for details)
- **Implementation time:** 15-30 min (upload SVG to website) vs 2-3 hours (full brand rollout across platforms)
- **File size:** <2KB (fast page loads) vs >50KB (slow, impacts SEO)
- **Scalability:** Works at 16px vs illegible below 32px
- **Color accessibility:** WCAG AA vs AAA compliance (check with superpowers:designing-ui-color)

**Why quantification matters:** "More expensive" is vague. "$200 vs $50" lets user make informed decisions.

## Alternative Exploration (Show Your Work)

**Don't just present final options - document what you rejected and why.**

For each significant alternative considered but not recommended:

### Template:
**❌ Alternative: [Name]**
**Visual concept:** [Brief description]
**Why considered:** [What made this initially appealing]
**Why rejected for THIS context:** [Specific reasons tied to user constraints]

**Example:**

**❌ Alternative: Kanban Board Icon**
**Visual concept:** Three columns with task cards
**Why considered:** Direct visual connection to task management
**Why rejected for THIS context:**
- Too literal - looks like feature screenshot, not brand mark
- Complex detail doesn't scale to 16px favicon (cards become illegible)
- Doesn't differentiate from competitors (many task apps use board metaphors)
- Technical founder couldn't modify easily (too many small elements)

**Why show rejections:**
- Demonstrates thoroughness (didn't just pick first idea)
- Prevents user from suggesting rejected options later
- Shows context-specific reasoning (not generic "boards are bad")

## Logo Design Principles

### Simplicity
- Works in solid black (no gradients required)
- Minimal elements, maximum impact
- Test: Can someone sketch it from memory?

### Scalability
- Readable at 16x16px (favicon size)
- Works at billboard scale
- Provide simplified version if needed for small sizes

### Distinction
- Doesn't look like competitors
- Memorable unique element
- Avoids cliches (globes for international, lightbulbs for ideas)

### Appropriateness
- Matches industry and audience expectations
- Considers cultural context
- Aligns with brand personality

## Validation Checklist

Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] Scales to 16x16px and remains recognizable
- [ ] Works in monochrome (solid black)
- [ ] Has sufficient contrast (WCAG AA minimum - use superpowers:designing-ui-color for validation)
- [ ] Exports cleanly as SVG (use superpowers:svg-generator for production files)
- [ ] Typography is readable at all sizes (if wordmark - check with superpowers:designing-ui-typography)
- [ ] No trademark conflicts (visual similarity check)
- [ ] User understands strategic rationale

## Common User Pressures - How to Handle

### "Include everything meaningful to us"
**Reality:** Effective logos are radically simple. Nike, Apple, Target use ONE element.
**Response:** Suggest primary logo + extended brand system for other elements.

### "Make it like [famous logo]"
**Reality:** Creates legal risk and positions as derivative.
**Response:** Explore what they admire (simplicity? memorability?) and create original expression.

### "We need it immediately"
**Reality:** Rushing skips discovery = wrong solution fast.
**Response:** Minimum viable discovery (15 min) beats no discovery. Always do some.

### "Just give me options to choose from"
**Reality:** Options without strategy = random aesthetics.
**Response:** Every option needs positioning rationale. No strategy = no design.

### "Don't ask questions, just design - you're the expert"
**Reality:** Experts ask MORE questions, not fewer. Discovery is expertise.
**Response:** "The questions ARE the expertise. 3 quick questions (2 min) prevents designing the wrong solution. What's your unique value vs competitors?"

## Color Selection

**For all color decisions, use the superpowers:designing-ui-color skill.**

The superpowers:designing-ui-color skill provides:
- Color psychology and brand associations
- Industry-appropriate color palettes
- Accessibility and contrast validation (WCAG compliance)
- B2B vs B2C color strategies
- Cultural considerations for global brands

**Quick reference:** Load superpowers:designing-ui-color skill when selecting logo colors.

## Typography Selection

**For all typography/font decisions, use the superpowers:designing-ui-typography skill.**

The superpowers:designing-ui-typography skill provides:
- Font pairing and hierarchy guidance
- System font vs custom typography trade-offs
- Licensing and cost considerations
- Readability and accessibility standards
- Brand personality expression through type

**Typography decisions for logos:**
- Wordmark fonts (when logo includes company name)
- System fonts for budget constraints (free, widely available)
- Custom typography for premium brands (licensing costs $200-$10k)
- Font weight and style selection

**Process:** Determine logo type (icon-only, wordmark, combination) → Use superpowers:designing-ui-typography if text is involved

## Technical Delivery

**You MUST create actual SVG files, not just describe them.**

**For all SVG creation, use the superpowers:svg-generator skill.**

The superpowers:svg-generator skill provides:
- Production-ready SVG code generation
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic markup)
- Optimized file sizes and clean code
- Responsive viewBox configuration
- Multiple export variations

**Required deliverables (create with superpowers:svg-generator):**
1. Full color version (SVG) - CREATE actual file
2. Monochrome version (solid black) - CREATE actual file
3. Simplified version for small sizes (favicon, app icon) - CREATE actual file
4. Usage guidelines document (minimum size, clear space, implementation examples)

**Workflow:**
1. Design logo concept (sketch composition, plan elements)
2. SELECT colors using superpowers:designing-ui-color
3. CHOOSE fonts using superpowers:designing-ui-typography (if text/wordmark)
4. CREATE production SVG files using superpowers:svg-generator
5. VALIDATE all deliverables against checklist
6. DELIVER actual files to user

## Implementation Timeline (For DIY Users)

**When user will implement themselves, provide timeboxed breakdown:**

### Week-by-Week Implementation Plan

**Week 1 (Total: ~2 hours)**
- [ ] Upload SVGs to website/app (15 min)
- [ ] Export PNG for social media (30 min using free converter)
- [ ] Update profiles with logo (30 min)

**Week 2 (Total: ~1 hour)**
- [ ] Add fonts if needed (5 min - use superpowers:designing-ui-typography for font selection)
- [ ] Update CSS with brand colors (15 min - use superpowers:designing-ui-color for color values)
- [ ] Test across light/dark modes (30 min)

**Week 3 (Optional)**
- [ ] Order stickers/merch with logo ($50-100)
- [ ] Create email signature (10 min)
- [ ] Add favicon to web app (5 min)

**Why include time estimates:**
- Prevents overwhelm ("15 min per task" vs vague "implement logo")
- Allows planning around other work
- Sets realistic expectations (reduces surprise/frustration)

**When to skip:**
- User has dedicated design/dev team
- Agency handling implementation
- User explicitly doesn't want this detail

**When to always include:**
- Solo founders / bootstrapped startups
- Small teams without design resources
- Technical teams implementing visual work themselves

## Success Metrics (How You'll Know It Works)

**Provide observable metrics across time horizons:**

### Short-term Success (1-3 months)
- Users can identify your icon in browser tabs/app switchers
- No feedback that logo looks unprofessional or cheap
- Founder/team comfortable using logo in investor/user presentations

### Medium-term Success (6-12 months)
- Users mention logo positively in testimonials/feedback
- Logo appears in user-generated content (screenshots, tutorials, social posts)
- Passes scrutiny when onboarding larger/enterprise customers
- No urge to redesign despite company growth

### Long-term Success (2+ years)
- Changing logo would confuse or disappoint users (brand equity established)
- Logo has enough recognition to warrant trademark protection
- Merchandise with logo signals community/customer belonging
- Maintained differentiation as competitors evolved

**Why metrics matter:**
Gives user concrete checkpoints instead of subjective "does this feel right?" assessment.

**Adapt to context:**
- Startup metrics: User recognition, investor confidence, no redesign needed
- Enterprise metrics: Legal clearance, global market acceptance, brand consistency
- Non-profit metrics: Donor trust, mission alignment, community acceptance

## Common Mistakes (Pattern Recognition)

Share what you've seen go wrong in similar contexts:

### For Bootstrapped Startups:

**Mistake 1:** Spending 3+ months perfecting a logo before launching
**Reality:** First 1,000 users choose you for product value, not visual identity
**This project:** Logo ships in 1 week, lets you focus on product/customers

**Mistake 2:** Copying trendy aesthetics (gradients, glassmorphism, 3D effects)
**Reality:** Trends date quickly; rebrand needed in 18 months when trend passes
**This project:** Timeless approach won't need replacement as trends cycle

**Mistake 3:** Designing for "vision" (100k+ users) when you have 100
**Reality:** Logo needs to work TODAY while scaling gracefully
**This project:** Works at current scale and future scale without redesign

### For Enterprises:

**Mistake 1:** Changing logo frequently (every 2-3 years)
**Reality:** Brand equity takes 5-10 years to build; frequent changes reset recognition
**This project:** Built for 10+ year lifespan with minor evolution possible

**Mistake 2:** Design by committee (everyone gets input)
**Reality:** Consensus-driven design becomes bland and forgettable
**This project:** Strategic options with clear trade-offs, not infinite variations

### For Rebrands:

**Mistake 1:** Changing everything simultaneously
**Reality:** Abrupt changes confuse existing customers; gradual transition preserves equity
**This project:** Evolution strategy that respects existing brand recognition

**Why share mistakes:**
- Prevents user second-guessing decisions later (by preempting common doubts)
- Demonstrates context-specific reasoning (not generic advice)

## Common Rationalizations (Don't Fall For These)

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "User said don't ask questions" | Users don't know what questions prevent failure. Ask anyway. |
| "Deadline too tight for discovery" | 2-min discovery saves hours of redesign. Always faster. |
| "I'm the expert, I know what works" | Experts know context matters. No discovery = guessing. |
| "I'll make strategic assumptions" | Assumptions = guessing with fancy words. Ask the questions. |
| "I'll document my assumptions" | Documenting blind guesses doesn't make them valid. Ask. |
| "Brief has enough information" | Briefs omit crucial strategic context. Always incomplete. |
| "User will be annoyed by questions" | Users respect thoroughness. Amateurs wing it. |
| "Three options is overkill" | One option = no strategic thinking. Three shows expertise. |
| "Simple = less work" | Simple is hardest. Skip validation = amateur work. |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Designing without asking ANY discovery questions
- Presenting only one design direction
- Presenting DESCRIPTIONS instead of actual SVG files
- Not using svg-generator to CREATE actual logo files
- Not using designing-ui-color to SELECT actual colors
- Not using designing-ui-typography to CHOOSE actual fonts (if wordmark)
- Using literal interpretation without exploration (CloudStack → stacked clouds)
- Not testing at 16px
- Creating complex gradient-heavy design
- Claiming "I'm not a designer" and refusing task
- Rationalizing "user said no questions" as permission to skip discovery
- Thinking tight deadline exempts you from process

**All of these mean: Step back and follow the process.**

## Example: Bad vs Good Approach

### ❌ Bad
User: "We're DataFlow. B2B SaaS. Modern and professional. Send me 3 options by 5:30pm. Don't ask questions, just design."
You: "I'll make strategic assumptions and deliver 3 options." [Creates logos without discovery]

**Problems:** No discovery (violated non-negotiable rule), made assumptions instead of asking, rationalized "strategic assumptions" to bypass process.

### ✅ Good
User: "We're DataFlow. B2B SaaS. Modern and professional. Send me 3 options by 5:30pm. Don't ask questions, just design."

You: "The questions ARE my expertise - they prevent wrong solutions. 3 quick questions (2 min) then I'll design:
1. What's your unique value vs competitors?
2. Who's your target buyer (IT managers or C-suite)?
3. Where will logo primarily appear (web app, presentations, both)?"

[User answers: Real-time data integration, targets data engineers, primarily web app with some presentations]

You: "Perfect. Creating 3 strategic directions now..."

[Uses superpowers:designing-ui-color to select colors, uses superpowers:svg-generator to create actual files]

You: "Here are 3 strategic directions with actual working logos:

**Direction 1: Real-Time Flow**
- File: `dataflow-realtime.svg` (attached)
- Colors: Electric blue (#0EA5E9) selected for speed/tech
- Design: Animated data streams
- Positioning: Emphasizes speed/real-time capability
- Trade-off: Complex, may not scale to small sizes

**Direction 2: Pipeline Architecture**
- File: `dataflow-pipeline.svg` (attached)
- Colors: Professional blue (#1E40AF) selected for trust/stability
- Design: Clean geometric pipeline
- Positioning: Emphasizes reliability/infrastructure
- Trade-off: More conservative, less distinctive

**Direction 3: DF Monogram**
- File: `dataflow-monogram.svg` (attached)
- Font: Inter Bold (chose via designing-ui-typography)
- Colors: Modern teal (#0D9488) selected for innovation
- Design: Letter-based with data flow integration
- Positioning: Balances professionalism with innovation
- Trade-off: Less immediately clear what you do

Which positioning resonates with your strategy?"

**Differences:** Responded to "don't ask questions" pressure by reframing questions as expertise, asked minimal discovery (3 questions), used answers to inform strategic directions, CREATED actual SVG files using supporting skills, presented trade-offs with actual deliverables.
